This is a game that I coded in Construct 2, entitled Agains the Story.
You can run the full version of it copying and pasting this link in a browser:  

matraph.github.io/AgainstTheStoryProject/AgainstTheStoryFinalVersion/  

And you can also run the only boss fight version on this one:  

matRaph.github.io/AgainstTheStoryProject/ATSBossVersion/  

And here is the project GDD:
